### Building a smart farm

We build completely our smart irrigation farm . We made skeleton for sprinkler using woods.

We plant green onion seeds and growing green onions  separately.

And We also divided the comparators and the experimenters into the same environment.

We use arduino and some sensors. There are temperature, air humidity, soil moisutre sensors.
